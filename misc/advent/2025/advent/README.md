# advent 2025

- day 1: `gleam run -m day01/a`
- day 2: `gleam run -m day02/a`

I've never written a line of gleam code before, let's give it a go.

It's a bit annoying that I can't make a project called `2025` and you can't seem to run gleam code outside of a project, so I've added an `advent` project here.
