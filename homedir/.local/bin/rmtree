rmtree [-vh] [-m <MAIN_BRANCH>] <worktree directory to delete>

remove a worktree from a git repository. Assumes you're in a directory with
folders representing both a worktree and the main branch of your project.

FLAGS:

    -h: print this help
    -v: verbose mode
    -m: MAIN_BRANCH defaults to `main`, and will check for `master` if that
        doesn't exist. Use this flag to pass a different main branch name.
        You may also set the MAIN_BRANCH environment variable to set the
        main branch name.
