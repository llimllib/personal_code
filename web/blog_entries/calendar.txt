Today, I needed a quick and dirty PDF calendar generator. Fortunately, with
python handy, it was blazingly easy to knock one up. Using the <a
href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-calendar.html">calendar moduule</a>
and the <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html">ReportLab PDF
library</a>, it took me about 10 minutes to learn enough of the API to get
started, and another couple of hours to finish the script - you can find it
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/files/pdf_calendar.py">here</a>.

<p>
Usage is pretty simple:<p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="60">from pdf_calendar import createCalendar
#create a December, 2005 PDF
c = createCalendar(12, 2005, filename="blog_calendar.pdf")
#now add January, 2006 to the end
createCalendar(1, 2006, canvas=c)
c.save()</textarea><p>
This script will create a PDF file called "blog_calendar.pdf" with two pages,
one for December 2005 followed by one for January 2006. More details can be
found inside the script.<p>
<b>update</b>: Now with <a
