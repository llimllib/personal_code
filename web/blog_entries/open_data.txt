Sketch of an Open Source Data Repository

One of the largest obstacles to creating effective data-mining software is the
scarcity of good data sets. If good data sets were easily available to people
on the web, I think it's likely that more people would come up with innovative
data mining applications. Some data sets that I would like to see:<p>
<ul><li><b>Stock Data</b>: I've been looking for a good repository of stock
data (on and off) for quite a while, and I've yet to find one.
<li><b>Del.icio.us Data</b>: How cool are the possibilities with a big
del.icio.us data dump? Has anyone created one? You could graph cliques of
users, find similar tags, find tag misspellings, or do a hundred other
interesting things with the data.
<li><b>Audioscrobbler Data</b>: Audioscrobbler publishes a data dump (available
<a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/data/">here</a>; it relates users of the
<a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com">audioscrobbler</a> system to the songs
that they listen to.
<li><b>Scientific Data</b>: Often, experiments generate more data than the
researchers who run the experiment can handle. Opening scientific data sets
could provide some interesting results due to the "many eyes" syndrome.
<li><b>Game Data</b>: There are hundreds of data sets of IRC poker games,
internet chess games, internet go games, and other games just waiting to be
gathered in one central location.
<li><b>Literary Data</b>: The <a href="http://www.promo.net/pg/">Gutenberg
Project</a> makes over 6000 books available in text on the web, but they are
not in a data-mining-friendly format. If tagged appropriately, it could be
trivial for me to graph comma frequency rates over the last 100 years to see if
they changed, or maybe even do something <em>interesting</em>.
<li><b>Internet Data</b>: Different collections of websites - corporate
websites, academic websites, random collections of websites.
<li><b>Open Source Code</b>: <a href="http://www.koders.com/">Koders</a> has 
shown that searching open source code can be valuable; certailnly interesting
statistics could be derived from a large collection of open source code.
</ul>
<p><h2>Problems</h2><p>
I can imagine several practical problems with such a data source. First is
copyright; assuring that the site had a copyright for so much data would be a
daunting task. Perhaps the responsibility for the copyright could be held by
the submitter?<p>
The format of the data would also be an interesting problem. To make the data
worthwhile, it would likely have to be constrained to some known subset of
well-documented data formats. It would require a fairly large effort to convert
existing data to an acceptable format, and verify that the data is
in the correct format.<p>
Documenting the meaning of the data contained in the files would also be a 
daunting challenge, requiring a fairly large effort. If the repository
contained a lot of data, but nobody knew what it meant, it would be
worhless.<p>
Finally, the site's success would be a part of its problem. Transferring large
data sets over the internet would create a hell of a bandwidth bill. Finding a
way to deal with this bill - through donations, advertising, or perhaps a fee
for use of the site - would be crucial to its success.<p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2><p>
The value of such a website is, in my mind, undeniable. If you could build a
community of users around it, I believe that novel applications of data-mining
techniques would inevitably arise. While administrative problems would be
significant, the success of such large open sites as <a
href="http://sf.net">Sourceforge</a> and <a
href="http://wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> leads me to believe that it's a
conceivable project.
