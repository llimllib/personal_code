Debugging Redis with Xcode
#time 08-26-12 23:14
<p>Recently I've been doing a bit of work on <a
href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>. While I code in vim, and that's not changing
any time soon, I've found Xcode to be a handy debugger.
It's not difficult to set up, but it is <em>extremely</em> unintuitive, so
I thought I'd write up a short visual guide.

<p>In this article, I'll assume that <code>~/code/</code> is your directory for
storing code; substitute your own directory where required.

<p>The first thing you'll want to do is check out a copy of redis. In your
<code>~/code</code> directory, clone the official redis repository:
<code>git clone https://github.com/antirez/redis.git</code>

<p>Next, open up Xcode and go to <code>File->New->Project</code> or click
<code>Create a New
Xcode Project</code>. On the left-hand pane select <code>Other</code>, and on
the right, <code>Empty</code>.

<p>Enter <code>redis</code> as the product name (or anything else if you so desire) in the
next panel, and
then choose a directory in which to store the xcode project. I recommend
storing it in a directory separate from your redis git directory, so that you
don't accidentally commit anything you don't intend.

<p>On the file picker, make sure the <code>Create local git repository for this
project</code> box is unchecked, as we won't be needing it.

<p>At this point, you should be looking at an empty project:

<p>Click on <code>File->Add Files to "redis"</code>, and choose the directory into which you
cloned redis. If you're following along, that should be
<code>~/code/redis</code>. After you do so, you should see the directory in
xcode's Project Navigator.

<p>Now we'll set up a build target, which tells Xcode how to build redis. Click
on <code>Add Target</code> towards the bottom of the Xcode window, and you should see
something like this:

<p><img src="images/xcode_redis/3.jpg">

<p>Choose <code>Other</code> under the OS X target types and
<code>External Build System</code> as
the type of target. On the next pane, enter <code>redis</code> as the product
name and
leave the rest of the values at their defaults, and click <code>finish</code>.

<p>Now, replace <code>$(ARGS)</code> in the <code>Arguments</code> input box
with <code>clean noopt</code> and enter the directory where you cloned redis in
the <code>Directory</code> input box. Mine looks like this:

<p><img src="images/xcode_redis/4.jpg">

<p>And now... you're almost there. Click the <code>Run</code> button at the
top left of the screen, and you should see a message saying <code>Build
Succeeded</code>.

<p>Finally, at the top left of the window, click on
<code>"redis"->Edit Scheme</code>.

<p><img src="images/xcode_redis/5.jpg">

<p>In the pane that drops down, click on the <code>Executable</code> drop down
and click on <code>other</code>, then select <code>src/redis-server</code> from
your redis directory. When you're done, the pane should look like this:

<p><img src="images/xcode_redis/6.jpg">

<p>This tells Xcode to start the redis-server executable after it builds redis,
so you can then connect to it via redis-cli, send commands, and debug them.

<p>To see if it works, click on the <code>run</code> button at the top left; redis should
build and Xcode should start redis-server for you. If you go to a console and
run <code>redis-cli</code>, it should connect to your localhost. At this point, you can
start adding breakpoints to dig in and see what redis is doing. Here's a
screenshot of me debugging src/redis.c, showing off some of xcode's debugging
features:

<p>Special thanks to Paul Smith, whose blog post <a
href="http://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2011/03/redis_get_set.html">taught</a> me
how to build redis so that it can be debugged.

<p>To learn a bit about the commands you can use to debug redis using the
window on the bottom right, you can go read <a
href="https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/5-learning-c-with-gdb">this post</a>
for a start (all the gdb commands are lldb commands too).

<p>Coming up next, I'll show you how to add a new data type to redis.
