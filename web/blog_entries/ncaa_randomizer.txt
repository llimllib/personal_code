The Bill Mill NCAA Bracket Randomizer

<p>Each year, when the NCAA basketball tournament comes around, I end up in
four or five pools, with a separate bracket filled out for each. I love the
games, and I love having teams to root for, but I really hate the process of
guessing to fill out my brackets. I inevitably pick too many upsets, just
because I want to have fun rooting for underdogs; instead I end up bored after
the first two rounds.

<p>This year, I thought I could write some software to help me pick out my
brackets. If I let the computer pick reasonably but randomly for each pool, I figure that I
stand a better chance of having <em>one</em> decent bracket instead of the
assortment of crappy ones I normally end up with.

<p>So the last two nights, I <a
href="http://billmill.org/ncaa-bracket-randomizer">wrote
myself a bracket randomizer</a>; just push the "randomize" button at the top and
watch it go.

<p>In order to pick what team will win a given game, it first calculates the
chance each team will win by plugging <a
href="http://kenpom.com/rate.php">Ken Pomeroy's</a> ratings
into the <a
href="http://www.diamond-mind.com/articles/playoff2002.htm">log5</a> formula.
Then it picks a random number and compares it to the probability of the
favorite winning; if the number is lower than that, it advances the favorite.
Otherwise, it advances the underdog. Rinse and repeat, and you should have a
reasonable random bracket for the whole tournament.

<h2>The Output</h2>

<p>Next to each team in the bracket, you'll see three numbers in parentheses.
These numbers represent, respectively, the team's Pythagorean rating, adjusted
offensive efficiency, and adjusted defensive efficiency.

<p>If that's Greek to you (<em>groan</em>), go check out <a
href="http://www.kenpom.com/blog/index.php/weblog/ratings_explanation/">Ken's
explanation</a> of what that means.

<p>The color of each team, once you've randomized, represents their odds of
winning. Brighter green is more of a favorite, deeper red more of an underdog.
It should update the colors if you manually change the teams, but it won't; I
just didn't have time to get everything done that I wanted to. Similarly, it
won't update future games if you change the winner of an early one.

<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>The surprisingly difficult part of this project was creating a simple HTML bracket that
looked reasonable and allowed you to click to advance a team. I didn't get
everything into the page that I wanted to, simply because I spent so much time
just getting that done. (Keep in mind we're talking about a 2-night hack here).

<p>The code to generate the bracket is contained in one super-ugly <a
href="http://github.com/llimllib/ncaa-bracket-randomizer/blob/1db753ce4f91fc84265efa6a27fa7ee00e84eaa2/bracket.py">python
file</a>.

<p>If you've got ideas for stuff to add, or want to generate a cooler looking
bracket, or just check out the code, you can <a
href="http://github.com/llimllib/ncaa-bracket-randomizer/tree/master">go get
it</a> at github. Feel free to fork and enjoy!
