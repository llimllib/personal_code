<a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/">Pyrex</a>
is a program which will compile programs written in its pythonic syntax
directly into C modules, available from python and (hopefully) fast. However,
most of the documentation assumes that you're on Linux. If you're not (say, for
example, your f&%$ing wireless card won't work on Ubuntu, grrr...) then these
instructions will help you get up to speed and running the prime number example
from their webpage:<p>
<ol><li>Complete the instructions from <a
href="/compile_python_on_cygwin">yesterday's
article</a> on how to compile windows extensions with cygwin.
<li>Download and install <a
href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/">Pyrex</a> in
the usual way (setup.py install)
<li>Put the following text into a text file called test.pyx:<p>
<textarea cols="50" rows="20">
def primes(int kmax):
  cdef int n, k, i
  cdef int p[1000]
  result = []
  if kmax > 1000:
    kmax = 1000
  k = 0
  n = 2
  while k < kmax:
    i = 0
    while i < k and n % p[i] <> 0:
      i = i + 1
    if i == k:
      p[k] = n
      k = k + 1
      result.append(n)
    n = n + 1
  return result</textarea>
<li>Put the following text in a file named setup.py in the same directory as test.pyx:<p>
<textarea cols="50" rows="10">
from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension
from Pyrex.Distutils import build_ext
setup(
  name = "PyrexGuide",
  ext_modules=[ 
    Extension("test", ["test.pyx"])
    ],
  cmdclass = {'build_ext': build_ext}
)
</textarea>
<li>in the same directory as test.pyx and setup.py, run "python setup.py
build_ext --compiler=mingw32"
</ol>
When I ran it, I got a whole bunch of warnings, but ended up with a file called
test.pyd. Start python, import test, and try "test.primes(10)" to see if you
get the first 10 prime numbers. All of those warnings appear to be types which
are declared but not defined, so I'm not too worried about them.<p>
Hopefully this helped you get Pyrex running on Windows and compiling via
the Cygwin C compiler. If not, you can try dropping me an <a

list</a>. Good luck!
