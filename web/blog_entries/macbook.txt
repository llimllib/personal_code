Summed up very succinctly:<br>

This means that my Macbook Pro, which I received on December 26, 2006, has been 
up and running, without a reboot, for 36% of its active life.<p>
This is despite the fact that it's been my alarm clock every morning during 
that span, so it's gone to sleep and woken up at least once every single day, 
and usually more than once. Furthermore, it's been used for development in C, 
Python, erlang, C#, IronPython, Pypy, and probably a few others. I've installed 
many programs during this time, viewed many PDFs, probably opened 10,000 tabs 
in Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Camino, and run quite a few Windows sessions 
with Visual Studio in Parallels.<p>
This laptop stability is a wholly new experience for me; Windows and Linux both 
have required fairly frequent reboots on the laptops I've had, and I've had 
several between 2000 and now. It's awesome to be able to trust the sleep and 
hibernate modes of the computer; certainly it's foreign to this Linux 
convert.<p>
Now, that doesn't mean I've turned into a raving Mac fanboy. I think much of 
their software sucks, the dock still annoys me, and their computer is nigh on 
unusable without <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.  
However, their laptop hardware and its integration into the OS has been all 
that I hoped for and more.<p>
UPDATE: A few hours after posting this entry, a security update forced a reboot :)
