Reverse File Iterator and Premature Optimization

This afternoon, I had a need for a reverse file iterator in a script I was 
writing to process a quite large log file. After some unsuccessful googling 
followed by some quick hacking, I was left with a frustratingly close, but 
nonfunctional, iterator. Instead of fixing it while I was at work, I hacked up 
a solution calling "tail" and left it for a while.<p>
When I came back to finish the job this evening, I figured that I ought to go 
look at the <a 
href="http://ftp.bg.openbsd.org/OpenBSD/src/usr.bin/tail/">source</a> of tail 
for some inspiration. Surely the unix hackers had figured this problem out long 
ago? In <a 
href="http://ftp.bg.openbsd.org/OpenBSD/src/usr.bin/tail/reverse.c">reverse.c</a>, 
I found the inspiration I needed:<p>
<code lang="c">    for (; pos >= start; pos--) {
        /* A seek per char isn't a problem with a smart stdio */
        if (fseeko(fp, pos, SEEK_SET) != 0) {
        //snip
            if ((ch = getc(fp)) == '\\n')</code><p>
I had been reading the file in chunks, splitting the chunk into lines, handling 
a cache of the lines, and compensating for unfinished lines, all because I had 
buried deep down in my lizard brain the idea that an fseek per character was 
"slow". In pure python, for chrissake!<p>
Properly reminded of the fact that premature optimization can sneak up 
anywhere, I ended up with this code:<p>
<code lang="python">import os

class reversefile(object):
    """Iterate backwards through a file. f should be an open file handle"""
    def __init__(self, f):
        self._f = f
        self.end = os.stat(f.name).st_size

    def __iter__(self): return self

    def next(self):
        if self.end == 0:
            raise StopIteration

        pos = self.end-2
        while pos >= 0:
            self._f.seek(pos)
            if self._f.read(1) == '\\n':
                end = self.end
                self.end = pos
                return self._f.read(end - pos - 1)
            pos -= 1

        end = self.end
        self.end = 0
        self._f.seek(0)
        return self._f.read(end).strip("\\n")</code><p>
You can see the whole thing, with source and some very brief tests I hacked up,
