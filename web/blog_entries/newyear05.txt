Thoughts on Stuff (Python, Poker)

After completing the redecorator (as much as it's ever gonna be done), I
basically dropped off the face of the internet. The week after Christmas, I
was busy playing with my new toys (Metal Gear Solid 3 is addictive) and
planning to go visit my college friends for a New Year party.<p>

To make a long story short, New Year's day, Saturday, my friend and I ended up 
in Atlantic City gambling. I didn't leave until Monday morning.<p>
Anyway, since I haven't been coding, I've had a while to think about some
things. Much randomness follows.<p>

<h2>Python</h2><p>
There has been all kinds of commotion about optional static types. If you could
guess from how I felt about <a 
href="http://billmill.org/redecorator.html">decorators</a>,
I'm not much of a fan of the proposed new syntax. Guido says that all kinds of
people want this feature, but since when has this been so important to the BDFL?
Furthermore, who are all these people that want static typing? Where are they 
hiding?<p>
Ian <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/peopleneedtochill.html">tells us</a> to
chill, but the thought of static types in python is genuinely disturbing. One
day before Guido posted his first blog, I wrote about how I was scared of the
c++ification of python, based on decorators. If static types were added, that
transition would be complete.<p>
Chris Petrilli is a lot <a 
href="http://www.amber.org/~petrilli/archive/2005/01/05/more_static_typing_nonsense.html">smarter</a>
than me, and wrote what I wanted to say <a
href="http://www.amber.org/~petrilli/archive/2004/12/23/static_typing_and_python.html">better</a>
than I could say it myself. Peter William Lount chips in with a well-written
<a href="http://smalltalk.org/articles/article_20050105_a2.html">article</a>
with the same conclusion as Chris. Finally, Hans Nowak comes closest to my
own opinion that <a 
href="http://zephyrfalcon.org/weblog2/arch_e10_00710.html#e717">python wouldn't
be python with static types</a>.<p>
<h2>Poker</h2><p>
To this point, I have kept this blog pretty programming-centric. While that
remains my main interest, I am also interested in games. My current main
interest is poker, although I have already dabbled in Go research in
college.<p>
While I was in Atlantic City, a very simple strategy at the poker tables netted
me a decent amount of money (about 13 small blinds per hour) at low-limit 
tables.
Basically, I played extraordinarily tightly. I figure that I played about 1% of
the hands that were dealt to me, only the cream of the crop plus my favorite
not-so-hot hand. I probably played another 1% or 2% of hands based on
situational factors, such as being on a blind or being alone against a bad
player.<p>
When I was in a hand, I played it very aggressively. I almost always bet the
maximum; I wanted to use my table image of conservatism to scare my opponents.
The great thing about the bad players that congregate at low-limit tables,
especially on holiday, is that they will often play to the river and then fold.
While I usually had more than one caller up to the turn, I rarely ever had to
show down against more than one player, and often had the pot folded to me.<p>
<h2>Poker Programming</h2><p>
On my <a href="http://llimllib.f2o.org/code.html">code</a> page, you'll see
that I wrote a python framework for poker bots on the <a
href="http://games.cs.ualberta.ca/webgames/poker/">poki poker</a>
servers at the University of Alberta. Soon, I'd like to reimplement and make
significant improvements to their poker server.<p>
I will probably implement this server in <a href="http://erlang.org">Erlang</a>.
Why? Just for kicks, and because the language looks pretty sweet. 
Thanks to
<a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004/12/even-more-on-reliability-and-static.html">Patrick Logan</a>
both for responding sensibly to a comment of mine, and for reminding me that I
wanted to try Erlang.<p>
I tried installing Erlang last night, but was unsuccessful. The install went
OK, but then when I tried to verify the installation as the documentation told
me to (toolbar:start().), it didn't work.<p>
UPDATE: While I was writing this, I noticed the period after the start()
function. I'm so conditioned to python that I didn't notice it, and erlang
appears to work now. I'll update on my progress soon.<p>
Happy New Year, everybody.
