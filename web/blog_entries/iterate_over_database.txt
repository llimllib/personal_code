Iterating Over Database Results in C#

<p>At my job, we use what is essentially a custom C# ORM. Soon after I arrived, 
we adopted this idiom to pull a DB connection from the pool and run a query:
<code lang="csharp"> class Something
{
    public int ourIdiom(long identifier)
    {
        using (DBConnection db = new DBConnection())
        {
            using (IDataReader rec = db.execQuery(@"
                SELECT some, rows
                FROM  Table1 t1, Table2 t2
                WHERE t1.t2id = t2.id
                AND   t1.id = ?",
                identifier))
            {
                while (rec.Read())
                    doSomething();
                return 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code>
<p>Which is nice because it disposes of both the connection and the dataReader 
properly on failure, but ugly because it uses a whole bunch of boilerplate.  
Unfortunately, because doSomething() needs to execute inside both 
<code>using</code> statements, and we weren't using C# 2.0 until a few months 
ago, the only way to avoid the boilerplate would have been to pass in 
delegates.
<p>This would have been just as ugly as keeping the boilerplate in the code, so 
we stuck with the using<sup>2</sup> idiom.
<p>Since our switchover to 2.0 a few months ago, I've had an idea that I could 
make this idiom more concise and remove some boilerplate that I didn't get a 
chance to try until this week. Using 2.0's iterators, which seem awfully 
familiar from my python work, that can be reduced to:
<code lang="csharp">class Something
{
    public int ourIdiom(long identifier)
    {
        foreach (IDataReader rec in new SQL().Query(@"
            SELECT some, rows
            FROM  Table1 t1, Table2 t2
            WHERE t1.t2id = t2.id
            AND   t1.id = ?",
            identifier))
        {
            doSomething();
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
</code>
<p>With some fairly simple code:
<code lang="csharp">public class SQL : 
    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<IDataReader>
    {
        string m_sql;
        ArrayList m_sqlparams;

        public SQL()
        {
        }

        public SQL query(string sql, params object[] sqlparams)
        {
            m_sql = sql;
            m_sqlparams = new ArrayList(sqlparams);
            return this;
        }

        IEnumerator<IDataReader> IEnumerable<IDataReader>.GetEnumerator()
        {
            using (clsDBConnection db = new clsDBConnection(m_dbname))
            {
                using (IDataReader rec = db.execQuery(m_sql, m_sqlparams))
                {
                    yield return rec;
                }
            }
        }

        //this is required because IEnumerable<> inherits IEnumerable. bleh.
        IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() { return GetEnumerator() }
    }
}</code>
<p>This code should come in handy for more reasons than just its cleanliness.  
First off, if you ever need to change the idiom for accessing the DB, it's 
stored conveniently in one place.
<p>Second, It makes a prepared SQL call into something like a <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a>: a bit of code representing 
a future computation that can then be passed around to be performed later. An 
example:
<code lang="csharp">void setUpQueries(nameId, addressId, custId)
{
    List<SQL> stringsWeNeed = new List(new object[]{
        new SQL().query("SELECT name FROM names WHERE id=?", nameId),
        new SQL().query("SELECT addy FROM addresses WHERE id=?", addressId),
        new SQL().query("SELECT zip FROM customers WHERE id=?", custId)});

    List<string> strings = getOurStrings(stringsWeNeed);

    mangleStrings(strings);
}

List<string> getOurStrings(List<SQL> queries)
{
    List<string> strings = new List<string>();
    foreach (SQL query in queries)
    {
        foreach (IDataReader rec in query)
            strings.Add(rec.GetString(0));
    }
    return strings;
}</code>
<p>While the example is silly, this property can be exploited to seperate 
declaration from execution, which I often find to be a useful pattern.
<p>Though I am far from the <a 
href="http://www.base4.net/blog.aspx?ID=409">first person</a> to discover this 
simplification, I did figure it out on my own and I thought it was neat enough 
to share.

some details, and is completely untested, and probably doesn't compile.  You
